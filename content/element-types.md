# Element Types

## Headings

A simple section heading. You must also define the heading `"level"`, which should be an integer from 1 to 6.

```javascript
{
    "type": "heading",
    "level": 1,
    "styles": {},
    "children": ["Conclusion"]
}
```

## Paragraph

Basic body text. Paragraphs do not have any special keys.

```javascript
{
  "type": "paragraph",
  "class": "body",
  "styles": {},
  "children": ["All their equipment and instruments are alive."]
}
```
